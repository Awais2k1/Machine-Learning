# K-Means Clustering Implementation

This repository contains a Colabe notebook implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique for partitioning datasets into distinct groups based on similarity.

## Overview

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters based on similarity. The goal is to group data points such that points in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

## Algorithm Steps

The K-Means clustering process follows these key steps:

1. **Decide number of clusters (k)**: Choose the number of clusters to partition the data into
2. **Initialize centroids**: Randomly select k points as initial cluster centers
3. **Assign clustering**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid
4. **Move centroids**: Recalculate centroids as the mean of all points in the cluster
5. **Finish**: Repeat steps 3-4 until centroids no longer change significantly

## Notebook Contents

The Colabe notebook includes:

- Explanation of K-Means clustering concepts
